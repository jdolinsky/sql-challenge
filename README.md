# SQL Challenge
# Employees During 1980-1990's Analysis. 
## Overview
The data containing employee and department information were imported from several CSV files. Based on the data structure, corresponding tables were created in a Postgresql database. The database schema can be found in [schema.sql](EmployeeSQL/schema.sql) file. The Entity Relationship Diagram image can be viewed [here](EmployeeSQL/employess_ERD.png). Data from CSV files was manually imported into corresponding tables in the Postgresql database.

Data Analysis includes several SQL queries:
* List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name (2 points)
* List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name (2 points)
* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B (2 points)
* List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name (2 points)
* List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name (4 points)
* List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name) (4 points)

All queries can be found in this [document](EmployeeSQL/solution.sql).
